## Installation

Install the plugin using the built-in plugin manager (see [releases](https://github.com/cloudogu/helm-sudo/releases)  for latest version):

```
# Installs latest commit
helm plugin install https://github.com/cloudogu/helm-sudo
# Installs deterministic version
helm plugin install  https://github.com/cloudogu/helm-sudo --version=0.0.1
```

## Usage

Its usage is pretty simple, just use "sudo" on your helm commands like so:

```
helm sudo list 
```

what the plugin does is, it adds the --kube-as-user and --kube-as-group flags with your user ($USER) and system:masters group to the given helm command. 

So the plugin executes the following: 

```
helm --kube-as-user $USER --kube-as-group system:masters list
```

Flags will just be passed along to the command you are calling. 

**CAUTION: Due to the usage of this plugin, you will execute the helm command as admin on your cluster!**

Syntax completion works with helm version 3.8.0 and up.
